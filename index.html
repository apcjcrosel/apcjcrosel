                    <h2>About</h2>
                        <h1>My Introduction</h1>
                        <p><strong>Why Yes?</strong></p>  
                        <p> I have been exposed to Information Technology since elementary because my brother and uncle are IT graduates and I also enjoyed programming when I was in Junior High School. </p>
                        <p><strong>If no, what course would you choose?</strong> -</p> 
                        <p><strong>I.T. Experience:</strong></p>  
                        <p> During my stay at APC-SHS, I have developed different projects along with my classmates. It includes game development, web development, and many more. During SHS Bootcamp we've partnered with the programmers of Asia Pacific College to develop a website for SMIC job postings but since the pandemic happened, our part was not implemented. </p>
                        <p><strong>Hobbies/Interests:</strong></p>  
                        <p> Aside from studying, I also invest my time in volunteering at Philippine Red Cross. When I am not busy, I love to watch movies and series.  </p>
                        <p><strong>Goals in life:</strong> To find a stable job to help my family and to buy the things that I want.</p>
                        <p><strong>What do you expect to learn from this course? </strong></p>  
                        <p>I expect that we will tackle advanced web programming both front-end and back-end. </p>
                        <p><strong>What do you want to learn to help you in your chosen Major?  </strong></p>  
                        <p>Aside from programming languages, I want to learn how to manage a project starting from ideation up to implementation. </p>
